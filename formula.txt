Suppose the server side countdown is 'x', the client side countdown is 'y';

so the relation is ,

     (96+(x*4.5))/100=y;

   for example if x=1;
       y =  96+(1*4.5)/100=100/100=1.00

       if you want y = 30.00;

       x = ((y*100)-96)/4.5 = ((30*100)-96)/4.5 = 645.33;
   so, you can put x=646 to get a countdown to 30.00;
